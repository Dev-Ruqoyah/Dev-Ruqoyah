 **About Me**
I build interactive, high-performing web applications that balance aesthetics, accessibility, and efficiency.
Every project I work on is an opportunity to merge design thinking with code - creating digital experiences that feel simple, fast, and human.

My recent work spans **e-commerce platforms**, **real-time communication tools** and **student-dashboard**  - powered by technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Firebase, and Supabase.
Iâ€™m particularly drawn to projects that challenge me to think critically about performance, scalability, and user experience.
